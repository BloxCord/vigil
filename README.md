**Microservices Status Page. Monitors a distributed infrastructure and sends alerts to Slack.**

Vigil is an open-source Status Page you can host on your infrastructure, used to monitor all your servers and apps, and visible to your users (on a domain of your choice, eg. `status.example.com`).

It is useful in microservices contexts to monitor both apps and backends. If a node goes down in your infrastructure, you receive a status change notification in a Slack channel.

**ðŸ‘‰ See a live demo of Vigil on [Crisp Status Page](https://status.crisp.chat).**

**ðŸš¨ Vigil is currently Work In Progress (WIP). Stable version is coming soon (2 months ETA).**
